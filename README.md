# Ham Radio Test Questions Extractor

This is a simple node.js script that will take the exam questions for the US FCC Amateur Radio license test, as published by National Conference of Volunteer Examiner Coordinators, and convert them into a format that allows import into the Mnemosyne Project's free flash-card tool that optimizes the learning process.

This was a personal project for myself to both practce a little coding and get the questions into a flash-card app so I can study. I may update it, I may not. It's pretty simple so anyone can use and I figured I'd share.
